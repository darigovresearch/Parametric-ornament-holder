## Usage

### Organising
Open in FreeCAD, open the spreadsheet to edit the parameters, then export the extruded file to an .stl for your slicer

### Printing
Best is to print with recycled materials to reduce the impact of plastic in the environment. 

You can also use a piece of string if your ornament has a hook, ideally cotton or a non-synthetic material.
